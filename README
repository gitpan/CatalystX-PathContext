CatalystX-PathContext version 0.0.1

This Role allows your Catalyst app to provide multiple path prefixes aka
a context with none or multiple url path based arguments.

You can specify as much path prefixes as you like and give them a name
and use a matchp for matching them. If the module finds a configured
path prefix you could find all info in the catalyst stash and it could be
used for whatever you like (eg. use a different view for different
languages).

If you use this module your Catalyst controllers would be reachable via
the default urls but also over urls which are prefixed with anything you
would use as prefix.
